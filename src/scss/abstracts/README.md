# Abstracts

The `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be placed in this folder.

The basic rule for this directory is that is should not output a single line of CSS on its own when compiled. These should be helpers for better Sass development.
