# Pages

If you have page-specific styles, you should place theme here in the `pages/` folder, in a file named after the page. For instance, it's not uncommon to have very specific styles for a home page, so you could create a `_home.scss` file in `pages/`.

*Note - Depending on your deployment process, these files could be called on their own to avoid merging them with the others in the resulting stylesheet. Completely personal preference.*
