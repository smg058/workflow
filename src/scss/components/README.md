# Components

For small components, there is the `components/` folder. While `layout/` is macro (defining the global sections of the wireframe), `components/` is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, loader, button, widget, counters, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in `components/` since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
